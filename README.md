## Usage
üëâ To use one of these configurations, simply open the configs.txt file located in the root directory. This file contains a list of links to various 2ray configuration files that you can use with your V2ray client. Copy [THIS LINK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/All_Configs_Sub.txt) link of the configuration file you want to use from the configs.txt file and import it into your V2ray client. Refer to your client's documentation for more information on how to do this.

Just Copy these links to your client to use :

Subscription 1 : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Sub1.txt

Subscription 2 : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Sub2.txt

Subscription 3 : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Sub3.txt

Subscription 4 : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Sub4.txt

Subscription 5 : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Sub5.txt

Subscription 6 : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Sub6.txt

Subscription 8 : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Sub8.txt

üîí To ensure the best possible performance and security, we recommend subscribing to our latest configurations using the subscription link feature. Simply copy the subscription link from the configs.txt file and paste it into your V2ray client to receive automatic updates every 10 minutes.

üóÇÔ∏è For easier configuration management, we have split the configuration files into individual files for each protocol and added them to the Splitted folder. To have easy access to seperated Configs use this : 

Vmess : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Splitted-By-Protocol/vmess.txt

Vless : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bardiafa/Free-V2ray-Config/main/Splitted-By-Protocol/vless.txt

## Requirements and How to Use
üì≤ Here are best ways to use V2ray on different operating systems:

### üíª Windows and üêß Linux
On Windows, we recommend using [Nekoray](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/nekoray) or [V2rayN](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN) client. To import a configuration file in `nekoray` , simply open the app then on the Program icon , select "Add profile from clipboard", and paste the configuration link. To import a configuration file in `V2rayN`, simply right-click on the V2rayN icon in the system tray, select "Import from clipboard", and paste the configuration link. For the official client, click on the "V" icon in the system tray and select "Import Config".

### ü§ñ Android
On Android, we recommend using [V2rayNG](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG) or [HiddifyNG](https://github.com/hiddify/HiddifyNG) or [NekoBox](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid). To import a configuration file, open the app and click on the "+" icon in the bottom right corner. Then, select "Import Config from Clipboard" and paste the configuration link.

### üçé Mac and üì± iOS
On Mac, we recommend using the [FairVPN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fair-vpn/id1533873488). To import a configuration file, simply open the app then at the end of page click "Import VPN Configs" and paste the configuration link then hit "ok".
